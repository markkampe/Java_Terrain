<H3>History</H3>
<P>
<P>
The development of this tool was motivated by 
<A href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/christopher-kampe-8a386048">Christopher Kampe</a>'s
observation that, in RPG development, the creation of the underlying maps had 
a relatively poor cost/value performance.  He wanted to make it easy for 
game developers to start with realistic maps, atop of which they could
add their more creative and interesting features and encounters.
</p>
This program is majorly inspired by the 
<A Href="https://mewo2.com">Marton O'Leary</a>'s
<A Href="https://twitter.com/unchartedatlas">Uncharted Atlas</A> project.
His
<A href="https:github.com/mewo2/terrain">Terrain Builder</a> is a
JavaScript Web-app to synthesize pages of a fantasy Atlas.
The <em>WorldBuilder</em> is Java application to enable game designers
to create 3D regional landscapes that can be exported as maps for a 
variety of computer-based Role Playing Games (starting with RPG Maker).
While these goals have very different scopes, calling for rather
different approaches, this program still draws heavily on several of
O'Leary's insights:
<UL>
   <LI> defining a large Cartesian landscape by
   	interpolations of the altitudes of (randomly
	placed) points in a Voronoi mesh.</li>
   <LI> defining (satisfyingly irregular) topographic
   	features by imposing vertical displacements associated
	with regular (e.g. conical) geometric figures
	on the random Voronoi mesh.</li>
   <LI> simplifying the simulation of water-flow by
   	restricing all flow to the paths between 
	(the few) points in the Voronoi mesh</li>
   <LI> using that flow to compute erosion as a 
   	downards deformation of the points through
	which water flowed.</li>
   <LI> defining geo-political borders as the points
   	where the cost of travel from two adjacent
	capitals are equal.</LI>
</UL>
</P>
<P>
The evolution of this tool has been driven by a combination of 
<A Href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/markkampe">Mark Kampe</a>'s 
architectural thoughts (about how to structure geo-physics simulations 
and plug-in RPG-map exporters) and
Christopher Kampe's experiences (with how to make a more usable tool
for creating satisfying worlds).
</P>

<a name="overview">
<H2>Structural Overview</H2>
</a>
<P>
To greatly over-simplify, this program can be divided into:
<ul>
	<li>a set of points (in a Voronoi, triangluar, mesh) each of which has
	    a variety of attributes (e.g. altitude, soil type, water flow).</li>
	<li>a collection of graphical renderers to display 2D maps to illustrate
	    those attributes (e.g. topography and water, erosion and deposition, etc.).</li>
	<li>a collection of exporters, to translate such maps into a form that can be
	    imported into another program (e.g. RPG Maker).</li>
	<li>a collection of dialogs and editors for changing the attributes (e.g.
	    creating mountains or changing water flow) of map points.</li>
	<li>a collection of menus and dialog widgets for accepting and executing commands.</li>
	<li>a collection of parsers to read program parameters, maps,
	    and export generation rules from (mostly <em>JSON</em>) configuration files.
</ul>
<P>
The classes that create and operate on Meshes of Voronoi points are
<A href="JavaDoc/worldBuilder/Mesh.html">Mesh.java</A>,
<A href="JavaDoc/worldBuilder/MeshPoint.html">Mesh.Pointjava</A> and
<A href="JavaDoc/worldBuilder/MeshPointHasher.html">MeshPointHasher.java</A>.
The set of MeshPoints that define the world are stored in a <em>Mesh</em> array.
Their attributes (e.g. altitude, soil type, water flow) are stored in parallel arrays
(e.g. <tt>Map.heightMap</tt>, <tt>Map.soilMap</tt>, <tt>Map.fluxMap</tt>) ... 
all of which are accessed through their common <em>MeshPoint index</em>.
</P>
<P>
There are several different map renderers, one for each major attribute:
<a Href="JavaDoc/worldBuilder/AltitudeMap.html">AltitudeMap.java</a>,
<a Href="JavaDoc/worldBuilder/ErodeMap.html">ErodeMap.java</a>,
<a Href="JavaDoc/worldBuilder/RainMap.html">RainMap.java</a>,
<a Href="JavaDoc/worldBuilder/RiverMap.html">RiverMap.java</a>,
<a Href="JavaDoc/worldBuilder/SoilMap.html">SoilMap.java</a>,
<a Href="JavaDoc/worldBuilder/TopoMap.html">TopoMap.java</a>,
<a Href="JavaDoc/worldBuilder/WaterMap.html">WaterMap.java</a>.
The mapping from a (sparse and irregular) Voronoi mesh to a 
(dense and continuous) 2D map is greatly facilitated by the
<a Href="JavaDoc/worldBuilder/Cartesian.html">Cartesian.java</a>
interpolation service.
The overall orchestration of creating a display from all of these
independent layers is managed by (the largest and most important class in the program)
<a Href="JavaDoc/worldBuilder/Map.html">Map.java</a>.
</P>
<P>
All Exporters implement a 
<a Href="JavaDoc/worldBuilder/Exporter.html">standard interface</a>,
and a common
<a Href="JavaDoc/worldBuilder/ExportBase.html">export orchestrater</a>
creates a series of 2D per-tile maps which it pushes to the
output-format-specific implementations.
The simplest of these,
<a Href="JavaDoc/worldBuilder/JsonExporter.html">JsonExporter.java</a>,
simply creates a collection of per-point attribute descriptions.
More interesting is
<a Href="JavaDoc/worldBuilder/RPGMexport.html">RPGMexport.java</a>,
which uses tile placement rules (managed by
<a Href="JavaDoc/worldBuilder/TileRule.html">TileRule.java</a> and
<a Href="JavaDoc/worldBuilder/TileRules.html">TileRules.java</a>)
to drive a very <em>RPG-Maker</em>-savvy
<a Href="JavaDoc/worldBuilder/RPGMTiler.html">RPGMTiler.java</a>
to reproduce the map in tiles, and cause the (<em>RPG Maker map</em>) output to be written by
<a Href="JavaDoc/worldBuilder/RPGMwriter.html">RPGMwriter.java</a>.
</P>
<P>
The main-screen menus and controls are put-up and responded to by the main class
(<a Href="JavaDoc/worldBuilder/WorldBuilder.html">WorldBuilder.java)</a>.
Simple operations like saving updated maps and loading new ones, it handles
directly.  But display and update operations are handled by one
of the sub-dialog managers:
<a Href="JavaDoc/worldBuilder/LandDialog.html">LandDialog.java</a>,
<a Href="JavaDoc/worldBuilder/MeshDialog.html">MeshDialog.java</a>,
<a Href="JavaDoc/worldBuilder/MountainDialog.html">MountainDialog.java</a>,
<a Href="JavaDoc/worldBuilder/PointDebug.html">PointDebug.java</a>,
<a Href="JavaDoc/worldBuilder/RainDialog.html">RainDialog.java</a>,
<a Href="JavaDoc/worldBuilder/RegionDialog.html">RegionDialog.java</a>,
<a Href="JavaDoc/worldBuilder/RiverDialog.html">RiverDialog.java</a>,
<a Href="JavaDoc/worldBuilder/RuleDebug.html">RuleDebug.java</a>,
<a Href="JavaDoc/worldBuilder/SlopeDialog.html">SlopeDialog.java</a>,
<a Href="JavaDoc/worldBuilder/WorldDialog.html">WorldDialog.java</a>,
<a Href="JavaDoc/worldBuilder/ZoomDialog.html">ZoomDialog.java</a>.
These put-up and respond to their own widgets, but on-map selection
(e.g. of lines, rectangles or groups of MeshPoints) is handled by
<a Href="JavaDoc/worldBuilder/Map.html">Map.java</a>.
<br>
These dialogs effect their updates by creating updated copies of
the attribute maps (arrays containing the values of a particular attribute
for each <em>MeshPoint</em>) and using calling <em>set</em> functions
(e.g. <tt>setHeightMap()</tt> or <tt>setSoilMap()</tt>) in the
in the <em>Map</em> class.
</P>
<P>
Most program parameters are read-in and accessed through the <em>Singleton</em>
implemented by
<a Href="JavaDoc/worldBuilder/Parameters.html">Parameters.java</a>.
<br>
When a map is read in (or written out), this is done by
<a Href="JavaDoc/worldBuilder/Map.html">Map.java</a>.
<br>
<em>RPG Maker</em> tile placement rules are read in by 
<a Href="JavaDoc/worldBuilder/TileRules.html">TileRules.java</a>.
</P>
<P>
Most operations are initiated as a result of widget actions in the main class,
and most of those result in the creation of a new interactive dialog
by one of the sub-dialog managers.

<H2>Key Classes and Operations</H2>

The <em>worldBuilder</em> application is moderately large
(over 10,000 lines of code spread over a few dozen modules).
The high level class structure can be (crudely) summarized by
a few UML class diagrams.
</P>
<P>
The first class diagram shows the main <em>WorldBuilder</em> class,
the <em>awt</em> and <em>swing</em> GUI classes it builds on,
and the <em>Map</em> and <em>Mesh</em> classes that support
the <em>MeshPoints</em> on which the map is based.
Note that the only <em>Map</em> methods shown in this 
figure are those involved in basic map creation.
</P>
<a name="UML_fundamental"></a>

<H4>Mesh Creation</H4>
<P>
O'Leary observed that if we create map points in a rectilinear grid,
deformations tend to retain that (unnatural) rectilinearity.  This
problem is elimnated if the map points are placed at random.  
Truly random points exhibit unattractive degrees of sparse-ness
and clumpy-ness.  O'Leary evens this out by a few iterations
of connecting points into a Voronoi mesh and then choosing,
as new points, the centroids of those Voronoi polygons.
We use a <em>Voronoi</em> library to assign three neighbors to
each point and create the desired Mesh.
</P>
<P>
The second class diagram shows the simpler (non-point-attribute-editing)
dialogs and the primary <em>Map</em> class functions they use.
</P>
<a name="UML_display"></a>
<img src="ViewDialogs.png" width="800">
<P>
These are all very simple dialogs.  Some of them
(e.g. <em>PointDebug</em>) simply display the attributes of
a selected point.  
Others simply update parameters (e.g. <em>WorldDialog</em> 
adjusts the latitude, longitude and size of the world map).  
The most complex is probably the <em>ZoomDialog</em>, which
allows a sub-region of the world map to be selected, and
uses the <em>Map.setWindow</em> function to cause the 
displayed map to zoom into the selected sub-region.
</P>
<H4>Point and Region Selection</H4>
<P>
The <em>Map</em> class is a <em>Mouse</em> and <em>MouseMotion</em>
<em>Listener</em>, interprets mouse actions as selection attempts,
and indicates the selected points/areas on the currently displayed
map.  Any dialog that needs to know about point or region selections
can register as a 
<a Href="JavaDoc/worldBuilder/MapListener.html">MapListener</a>
and receive call-backs in response to selection actions.  They can
also use the <tt>Map.selectMode()</tt> and <tt>Map.checkSelection()</tt>
operations to enable the desired selection mode (e.g. point, line, region)
and query any selections that may have already been made.
</P>

<P>
The third class diagram shows the attribute-editing dialogs and the
<em>Map</em> selection and get/set functions they use to update
the <em>MeshPoint</em> attribute maps.
</P>
<a name="UML_edit"></a>
<img src="EditDialogs.png" width="2000">
</P>
<P>
The operations in this richer set of dialogs (a) update point attributes and 
(b) drive refreshes of the displayed map to show the updated information.
</P>
<H4>Attribute Maps</H4>
<P>
As random points in a 2D space <em>MeshPoint</em>s are not very exciting.
What makes them interesting is the collection of attributes associated
with each point.  As mentioned previously, each <em>MeshPoint</em> has
a stable index in the <em>Mesh</em> array, and the <em>MeshPoint</em>
attributes are stored in series of parallel arrays:
<ul>
	<li><tt>heightMap</tt> stores the altitude (in -0.5 to +0.5 map coordinates) 
	     of each <em>MeshPoint</em></li>
	<li><tt>soilMap</tt> stores the mineral type (sedimentary, metamorphic, igneous, alluvial)
	     of each <em>MeshPoint</em></li>
	<li><tt>rainMap</tt> stores the annual rainfal (in cm)
	     for each <em>MeshPoint</em></li>
	<li><tt>hydrationMap</tt> stores the depth (in meters) of water
	     on top of  each <em>MeshPoint</em></li>
	<li><tt>fluxMap</tt> stores the flow of water (in cubic meters/year) 
	     into each <em>MeshPoint</em></li>
	<li><tt>erodeMap</tt> stores the net (negative) erosion or (positive) sedimentation
	     of each <em>MeshPoint</em></li>
</ul>
The attribute editing dialogs load the appropriate attribute maps from the <em>Map</em>
class, update them according to the user's instructions, and then pass the
updated values back to the <em>Map</em> class.
</P>

<H4>Displayed Map(s)</H4>
<P>
Whenenver attributes are changed the <em>awt.repaint()</em> method invoked,
causing a call to <tt>Map.paintComponent()</tt>.
</P>
<P>
There are many different
attributes for each <em>MeshPoint</em>.  Which will be displayed is controlled
by calls to <tt>Map.setDisplay()</tt>.
</P>
<P>
When the call is made to repaint the map, <tt>Map.PaintComponent</tt> will:
<ol type="1">
	<li>decide on the dimensions of the (to be updated) map.</li>
	<li>create a <em>Cartesian</em> interpolation matrix to compute
	    the values at every pixel from the nearest three <em>MeshPoints</em>.</li>
	<li>go through the display-enabled attributes, using the 
	    appropriate map-rendering class
	    (e.g. <tt>AltitudeMap</tt> or <tt>RiverMap</tt>) to compute
	    the attribute values for every pixel on the map and generate
	    the appropriate display updates.</li>
	<li>if any selection areas are to be highlighted, add appropriate
	    rectangles, lines or point-halos to indicate them.</li>
</ol>
</P>
<P>
The final class diagram shows the <em>Export</em> related classes
(that handle both raw JSON and <em>RPG Maker</em> maps).
