# Java_Terrain
Java 2D world builder GUI.  The idea is to use this tool to create a satisfying region (e.g. a few hundred km on a side), and then export sub-areas as maps for other RPG programs.  The iniital version of the tool will be able to create mountains and valleys, turn rain-fall into rivers and surface water, do erosion and deposition, and fill in general plant populations.  The inital export format will be RPGMaker tiles.

We have ideas for additional features (natural resources, villages and cities, trade and trade routes), but subsequent evolution will surely be driven by feedback (and hopefully, new contributors).  If you find this project interesting and would like to help or move it in new directions, please get in touch with us.

I started with a fork of MEWO2's Terrain builder, where I will continue to do commenting and refactoring, for my own education, and as a service to others who might be interested in this code.  But in working with it, I have realized that Javascript is a poor choice for a program that will operate on local files.  While this program has very different goals than O'Leary's, it greatly benefits form his thoughts on inexpensive generation of satisfying terrain.
