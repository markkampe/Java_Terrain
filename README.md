# Java_Terrain
Java translation of Martin O'Leary's fantasy map generator

I started with a fork of MEWO2's Terrain builder, where I will continue to do commenting and refactoring, for my own education, and as a service to others who might be interested in this code.  But in working with it, I have realized that Javascript is a poor choice for a program that will operate on local files.  This repo is where I plan to do the work to enhance the tool to be able to build more detailed maps that can be fed into RPGs.

In translating his project from Javascript to Java, I will greatly change the output and make other enhancements, but I retain his original License.  The code is available under the MIT license, so you can fork it, improve it, learn from it, build upon it.
