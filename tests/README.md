These are maps that Chris or I created in order to exercise the program or demonstrate a problem:
 - **CanyonTest.json**: many canions of varying depths, running in varying directions,
   enabling me to test how well a rising ocean worked its way inland.
 - **erodetest.json**: lots of rain-fall resulting (based on terrain) in many rivers
   of different speeds, so I can observe erosion and sedimentation.
 - **SinkBug.json**: another version of the erosion model, created to explore the way water
   collected in, and escaped from sinks.
 - **test_world_1.json**: a map Chris created to thoroughly exercise the land-form creation
   capabilities.  Because of its rich topography, it is a good place to start for other tests.
 - **test_world_2.json**: it turns out that test_world_1 was so shallow that, when significant
   rain was added, it became very covered with water.  To use it for (highly rainfall sensitive)
   flora placement testing, I gave it a little more tilt, and then added graduated rainfall,
   followed by rule-based flora placement.  It is a more interesting version of the same
   terrain.
 - **test_world_3.json**: adds cities, trade-routes, and includes a few other updates to
   enable the testing of newer features.
